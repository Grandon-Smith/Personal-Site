                  <p>I'd always had an interest in technology and building things. I had a construction orieneted mindset from the time I was a little kid. 
                    I wasn't particularly strong with math growing up, I wrote off any kind of coding for fear I wouldn't be capable of a career.
                    After studying health sciences in undergrad, I applied to, and was accepted to several graduate programs for physical therapy. 
                    After a year of attending, I ultimately decided I was not following the right path for me. While I was in school though, I had discovered codecademy, 
                    which sparked my interest and initially got me hooked on coding. I juggled working and coding in my free time, using resources like codecademy,
                    the odin project, and freecodecamp. After moving home to Connecticut again in July 2020 (where I'm currently located), I decided now was my best 
                    chance to really see what coding was about, so I enrolled in Thinkful's remote coding bootcamp, and here I am now!</p>

                <p>Since starting coding, I've been self directing my studies for nearly a year, developing a strong foundation of web development basics 
                  before I began the Bloc program. Now having started, being given some true direction for my learning,
                  and working with my mentor, my excitement for web devlopment has only increased. I understand
                  now more than ever just how much more I have to learn. But now, rather than daunting, it's promising and exciting.
                  The other big insight I've gained thus far is how important working well collaboratively with others is. As the scale of my projects increase both in 
                  size and complexity, it has become more apparent how much more could be accomplished if teamwork with other developers could be
                  utilized properly! While my skill set is still growing, Currently I'd be happy to create website projects using:
