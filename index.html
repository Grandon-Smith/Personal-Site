            <p>I'd always had an interest in technology and building things. I had a construction orieneted mindset from the time I was a little kid. 
              Throughout middle and high school I struggled significantly with mathmatics in general, particularly algebra. 
              Thinking that engineering and other construction based works required math of a high level, I wrote myself off as being incapable of doing anything of the sort. 
              This mindset caused me to not take any coding classes my high school offered, and instead focus on the health field.</p>

            <p>After studying health science in undergrad, I applied and was accepted to several graduate programs for physical therapy. 
              I attended the Northern Arizona University program for a year before taking a leave of absence, 
              and ultimately deciding I was not following the right path for me. While I was in school though, I had discovered codecademy, 
              which sparked my interest and initially got me hooked on coding. </p>

           <section>
            <p>After leaving the PT program, I stayed in Arizona for a year, working as a gym trainer, and coding in my free time using resources like codecademy,
               the odin project, and freecodecamp. After moving home to Connecticut again in July 2020, I decided now was my best 
               chance to really see what coding was about, so I enrolled in Thinkful's remote coding bootcamp, and here I am now!</p>

             I'm a visual person so I enjoy working with:
           </p>
           <ol>
             <li>HTML</li>

           </ol>
           <p>
               But I would soon like to learn:
           </p>
           <ol>
             <li>Java</li>
             <li>Python</li>
