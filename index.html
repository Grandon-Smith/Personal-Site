                  <p>I'd always had an interest in technology and building things. I had a construction orieneted mindset from the time I was a little kid. 
                    I was never great at math growing up, I wrote off any kind of coding for fear I wouldn't be capable of a career.
                    After studying health sciences in undergrad, I applied to, and was accepted to several graduate programs for physical therapy. 
                    After a year of attending, I ultimately decided I was not following the right path for me. While I was in school though, I had discovered codecademy, 
                    which sparked my interest and initially got me hooked on coding. I juggled working and coding in my free time using resources like codecademy,
                    the odin project, and freecodecamp. After moving home to Connecticut again in July 2020 (where I'm currently located), I decided now was my best 
                    chance to really see what coding was about, so I enrolled in Thinkful's remote coding bootcamp, and here I am now!</p>

                <p>Since starting coding, I've been self directing my studies for nearly a year, developing a strong foundation of web development basics 
                  before I began the Bloc program. Now having started, and working with my mentor, my excitement for we devlopment has only increased. I understand
                  now more than ever before how much more I have to learn, and how important working with others is, as the scale of my projects increase both in 
                  size and complexity. While my skill set is still growing, Currently I'd be happy to create website projects using:
